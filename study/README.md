# Study Information
This folder contains information about the study set up and results, as well as Python code for generating the figures from the paper.

## Downloading Study Data and Generating Figures
This directory contains a Docker compose setup that will download the study data from Google Drive and generate the figures from the paper (and others).
This requires that [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your system. Once installed, the below script
to download the study data to `./study_data./`, generate the figures found in `figures`, and print the LaTeX definitions of the tables to the console.

Configuring Docker and downloading the data used to generate the figures will take ~10 minutes. 
The figure generation should take ~1 minute.
There will be progress updates throughout.

```bash
./generate_figures.sh
```

The console output for running this command which contains the tables shown in the paper are in [output.txt](output.txt).
The figures generated are shown in [figures/](./figures).

### Typo in Table IV in the paper
***NOTE***: There is a typo in Table IV of the table, where the data are off by 1 percentage point for the Jaccard metric. The correct table is contained in the output.txt and replicated here:

|Mutation|Acc. TP | Acc. FP | Jacc. TP | Jacc. FP |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|----------|
|Add Rotate| 39 |  2| 634 |  77 |
|Add Mirror Rotate| 42 |  2| 672 |  79 |
|Remove| 6 |  ---| 26 |  --- |
|Vehicle Intensity| 63 |  2| 178 |  4 |
|Vehicle Deform| 5 |  ---| 10 |  --- |
|Vehicle Scale| 12 |  ---| 81 |  14 |
|Sign Replace| --- |  ---| 37 |  1 |
|Total| 167 |  6| 1638 |  175 |
| % | (97%) |  (3%)| (90%) |  (10%) |

### The study_data folder
The `./study_data/` folder contains the mutations generated and SUTs' performances evaluated for the study described in Section IV.
For information about the format of this folder and what information it contains, please see the `../tool/` [README](../tool/README.md).

## Study Set Up

### Resources Collected from SemanticKITTI
This table discusses the number of initial resources compared to the number ultimately selected for mutation.
Resource Collection is discussed in Section II-B, and the table below is discussed in Section IV-B.

### Study Parameters
During the study, the variables discussed in the Implementation Section were given the corresponding values below.
These values were chosen through small-batch experimentation to determine reasonable default values for a larger-scale study.
Individual testing goals, or testing using different data sets may necessitate changes to these values.  

|Parameter | Value | Discussion |
|--------|----------|------------|
|*minPointThreshold* | 20 points  |  Smaller entities may not contain enough context for mutation. | 
|*distThresh* | 40m  | Beyond this distance the points may be affected by noise. |
|*occlBuffer* | 25%  | By using a small over-approximation, we improve the invariants strictness.  |
|*minSignPoints* | 10 points | Due to the smaller nature of signs compared to other entities, the initial point threshold is reduced to allow for richer identification |
|*signSizeThreshold* | 3m  | Identified based on the size of real-life signs |
|*addOcclusionThreshold* | 10 points  | The small allowance balances the stringency of the invariant with the ability to generate mutations, smaller amounts are more stringent |
|*groundThreshold* | 33%  | Since objects may extend into other regions, requiring 33% to be in the specified area allows for variation while respecting invariants.|
|*groundDistanceThreshold* | 5m  | Determined by LiDAR intrinsics, with small buffer added |
|*removePointsAboveThresh* | 30 points  | Identified as a reasonable balance between stringency and ability to generate, smaller amounts are more stringent. |
|*invalidReplacementClasses* | car, bicycle, bus, motorcycle, truck, other-vehicle, moving-car, moving-bus, moving-truck, moving-other-vehicle, building, fence, other-structure, trunk, pole, traffic-sign, other-object  | Since these classes are often part of cohesive entities, they may not be disconnected and used for filling.|
|*intensityMutateThresh* | 0.8  | Determined based on examining un-paintable areas in existing data, e.g. license plates. |
|*intensitySubThresh* | 0.1  | Not an invariant - selected to produce variety in intensity mutations |
|*minIntensityThresh* | 0.1  | Not an invariant - the min amount to alter is chosen to produce sufficient variety from prior tests. |
|*maxIntensityThresh* | 0.3  | The max amount to alter invariant is chosen so that the new entity is within realistic limits. |
|*minDeformThresh* | 5%  | Not an invariant - the min number of points to alter is chosen to produce sufficient variety from prior tests. |
|*maxDeformThresh* | 12%  | The max amount to deform is limited as natural deformations are limited in size. | 
|*deformNoiseMean* | 0.05m  | Chosen based on the average size of vehicles. |
|*deformNoiseStdDev* | 0.04m  | Chosen based on the average size of vehicles. |
|*scaleAmount* | 105%  | Chosen based on the observed trends in vehicle sizes over the past 20 years. |
|*maxScalePointsThreshold* | 10000 points  | Chosen due to computational limits, larger values were found to be computationally infeasible. |
|*minScalePointThreshold* | 20 points  | Smaller entities may not contain enough definition for enlargement |
|*minSignHeight* | -1m  | Relative to the LiDAR mount height; lower signs may not be in the correct semantic context. |
|*signSizeAllowance* | 2m  | Buffer to allow for alterations while maintaining size constraints. Smaller is more stringent. |
|*minSignPointThreshold* | 15 points | Smaller signs may not contain enough definition for alteration. |

## Generating Figures 
This package is used to generate the figures used in the paper.
Due to compatibility issues, the rest of the system uses Python 3.6.9.
However, in order to leverage the new features in later versions of Matplotlib, the figure generation uses Python 3.10.
A new venv must be created for the figure generation.

```bash
sudo apt install python3.10-venv
python3.10 -m venv figure_venv
source figure_venv/bin/activate
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
