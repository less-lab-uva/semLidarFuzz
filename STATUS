# Status
We are applying for the Functional and Available badges for ICSE 2023.
The README, INSTALL, REQUIREMENTS, and other accompanying documents provide sufficient documentation and explanation to allow for the use of the tool, and we provide [automated scripts](./tool/tool_demo.sh) to facilitate tool demonstration.
These scripts are parameterized and can be extended for more in-depth demonstrations.

Additionally, we provide the complete study data from the experiments on [a public Zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/record/7569212#.Y9P3KRzMK_4).
We also include [scripts](./study/generate_figures.sh) for rendering the Figures and Tables from the paper based on this data.
