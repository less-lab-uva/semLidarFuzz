# Requirements
The tool requires Docker, Ubuntu (Tested on 18.04), and an NVIDIA Graphics Card with CUDA 10.0 & cudnn 7.
The fully containerized tool demo scripts require Docker Compose.

Running the tool without the SUTs has been validated on Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 11.

Newer versions of Ubuntu and NVIDIA CUDA/cudnn may work, but have not been validated.
