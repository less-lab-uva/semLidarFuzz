# Status
We are applying for the Reusable(/Functional) and Available badges for ICSE 2023.
The README, INSTALL, REQUIREMENTS, and other accompanying documents provide sufficient documentation and explanation to allow for the use of the tool, and we provide [automated scripts](./tool/tool_demo.sh) to facilitate tool demonstration.
These scripts are parameterized and can be extended for more in-depth demonstrations. Additionally, each part of the tool contains additional documentation on its configuration and code setup.

Additionally, we provide the complete study data from the experiments on [a public Zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/record/7569212#.Y9P3KRzMK_4).
We also include [scripts](./study/generate_figures.sh) for rendering the Figures and Tables from the paper based on this data.
